        <li>Create responsive search ads to let Google optimize combinations</li>
        <li>Monitor performance and pause underperforming ads</li>
      </ul>

      <ul>

      </ul>

        <li>Use conditional logic to show relevant questions</li>
        <li>Include privacy policy and clear value proposition</li>
        <li>Test different form layouts and field orders</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Effective keyword research is the foundation of successful SEO. It helps you understand what your audience is searching for and how to optimize your content to rank for those terms.</p>

      </ul>
      
      <h2>2. Keyword Research Tools</h2>

        <li>Better for voice search optimization</li>

        <li>Analyze their content strategy for target keywords</li>
        <li>Discover backlink opportunities through keyword research</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>5. Keyword Metrics to Consider</h2>

        <li><strong>Trends:</strong> Growing or declining search interest</li>
        <li><strong>SERP Features:</strong> Featured snippets, People Also Ask, etc.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>6. Organizing and Prioritizing Keywords</h2>
      <p>Create a strategic keyword plan:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Group keywords by topic clusters</li>
        <li>Prioritize by opportunity (volume × difficulty × relevance)</li>
        <li>Map keywords to specific pages</li>
        <li>Create content calendars based on keyword research</li>
        <li>Track rankings and adjust strategy based on performance</li>
